# RepoBrowser
Simple iOS GitHub Repository Browser

Repo Browser searches for open repositories on github. The app has two screens. The first is for the search query, second is for the repository details. The results of the last search are saved in a Core Data database and displayed when the application starts. Design pattern is mix of MVC and MVVM.
